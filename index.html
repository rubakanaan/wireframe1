        Meals are generally served and eaten on the premises, but many restaurants
        also offer take-out and food delivery services.Restaurants vary greatly in 
        appearance and offerings, including a wide variety of cuisines and service 
        models ranging from inexpensive fast food restaurants and cafeterias, 
        to mid-priced family restaurants, to high-priced luxury establishments.

    <label for=""> What Is a Restaurant Review?</label>
    <article>
     <br>
    A good review combines facts (price, menu choices, location,) with personal experience 
    (service received, ease of booking, ambience.) A restaurant review can be of a sit-down 
     meal, a takeaway, or a delivered foodie experience. It doesn’t matter whether you’re an 
    enthusiastic party-goer, a business expense diner, or a grab-a-quick-snack type of eater, 
    your views on food, and the service you receive can make an interesting read.
